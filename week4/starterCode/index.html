	<!-- This is the body of the webpage. It holds all the stuff you actually see on the page. Some common tags often used in the body, for reference:
		h1: Title. Goes up to h6 for 6 different kinds.
	    p: paragraph
	    a: link
	    img: image
	    ul: unordered (bulleted) list
	    ol: ordered (numbered) list
	    li: list element
		If you want to do something in particular, most of it is online. For example, forms are a little tricky, so I just google "HTML form" and copypaste if I need one.
		I'd show a form, but we'd need to send the data to a server, which we don't have.

	<!-- Loading the script at the end is a good idea because loading scripts takes a while. If the page doesn't need the JavaScript to work, it's a good idea. This way, your page doesn't lag trying to run all your code while the page is still getting all the text on the screen. -->
